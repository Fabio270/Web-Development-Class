# Web-Development-Class
This is a project I made for the Web development class. To whom it may concern, feel free to suggest changes or improvements.
Some things I couldn't manage to know such as making all the pictures with the same size or changing the collor of the buttons on the navigation bar.
Also the page I created is about witches because I like them, and I was out of Ideas. I used bootstrap for this project.
